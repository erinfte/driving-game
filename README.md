## Description
This pygame is a student project that will have the player drive a car and avoid oncoming traffic.
The player plays to reach their high score, and if the player collides with another vehicle, the player loses the game.
The project includes simple shapes and contrasting colors that resemble cars. In the future, I would try to implement some graphics that would represent the cars, but at the moment, the rectangles work well. I also have the collision properly implemented with the rectangle cars, so it serves its purpose.
The game functions as intended, and I am glad I was able to add a the score counter and make the car move fluidly in the game.
